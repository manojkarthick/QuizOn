This was launched in August 2012 by Sean Rad, Justin Mateen, Jonathan Badeen, and Dinesh Moorjani of Hatch Labs. It was initially piloted on college campuses, the first being the University of Southern California. It  uses Facebook profiles to gather basic information and analyze users' social graph, which then matches candidates who are most likely to be compatible based on geographical location, number of mutual friends, and common interests. It allows the users to anonymously like or reject potential matches using a simple swiping gesture. If two users are interested in each other, it is a "match" and it introduces the two users and allows them to chat. What are we talking about ?

Google posted a model code of conduct online for software developers and others taking part in an Explorer program providing early access to Google Glass. The company appeared intent on avoiding the kinds of caustic run-ins that have seen some Glass wearers being tossed from eateries, pubs or other establishments due to concerns over camera capabilities built into devices. The code of conduct says:

“Don’t be creepy or rude (aka, a X). Respect others and if they have questions about Glass, don’t get snappy. If you’re asked to turn your phone off, turn Glass off as well. Breaking the rules or being rude will not get businesses excited about Glass and will ruin it for other Explorers.”
